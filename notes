LIBRARIES vs FRAMEWORKS
=======================

LIBRARIES
---------
• Focused tool for specific tasks
• You control the program flow
• Call library functions when needed
• Examples: React, jQuery, Lodash, Axios
• More flexibility, less structure
• Easier to integrate into existing projects

FRAMEWORKS
----------
• Complete structure for building applications
• Framework controls the program flow (Inversion of Control)
• You fill in the blanks (callbacks, hooks, etc.)
• Examples: Angular, Next.js, Django, Spring
• Provides opinions and conventions
• Steeper learning curve, faster development for large apps

KEY DIFFERENCE
---------------
Library: You decide when and how to use it
Framework: It decides the structure; you follow its rules

WHEN TO USE WHAT
-----------------
Library: Small projects, integrating into existing code, flexibility needed
Framework: Large projects, starting from scratch, need structure
REAL DOM vs VIRTUAL DOM
-----------------------
• Real DOM: Actual browser DOM, slower to manipulate, direct changes
• Virtual DOM: In-memory representation, faster updates, React/Vue use it
• Virtual DOM diffing: Compares old and new versions, applies minimal changes
• Performance: Virtual DOM batches updates, reducing browser reflows
• Real DOM: Direct manipulation, immediate but expensive
• Virtual DOM: Abstraction layer, better for frequent updates
